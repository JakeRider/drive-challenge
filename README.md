# Drive Coding Challenge

## Requirements

- Node v20.10.0 (LTS)

## Installation & Usage

1. Ensure you are using the correct version of Node. If you use `nvm` (recommended), you can run `nvm use` in the root of this repo to automatically switch to the correct version.
2. Install the project's dependencies by running `npm i` in the root of this repo.
3. The tool accepts input via STDIN. If you have a file named `./input.txt` you can run `cat input.txt | npx ts-node ./src/index.ts` to process it.
4. Test can be run via the command `npm test`.
